     * Title:              MediaItem.cs and Child classes
     * 
     * Description: This class is for the storage, tranfer, and retrieval of media items in the catalog.
     * Each class inside this file is a child that inherits from the generic MediaItem class.  The MediaItem
     * class contains information common to every item such as title, description, and publishdate.  Along with this,
     * the MediaItem class also defines a getInfo() method whose purpose is to return the relevant information in a
     * format that will work within the Labels on the page (specifically the catalogeInfoX label).  Finally, there is a
     * single global variable called MediaType whose use is solely to help identify what type of media the object
     * is.  This is useful for discerning what is what during coding.
     * 
     * The current list of MediaTypes is:
     * 
     * 0 = generic MediaType
     * 1 = Book
     *
